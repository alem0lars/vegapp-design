<p><em>The navigation defines the main user interactions: those which triggers navigation inside the application, i.e. how the end-user should use it in order to change environments and to access its features.</em></p>
<p>The following diagram defines the main navigation flow, by defining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Screens</strong> (<em>ellipses</em>): these are the main views the user interacts with: Here we don't consider small views or details. Even <em>how</em> those screens are implemented will be specific to the particular device and technology chosen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Main Actions</strong> that can be taken (<em>arrows</em>): An arrows triggers a transition from a view to another (possibly the same) view. Here we don't consider small actions or interactions but only the macro interactions: those which usually trigger screen changes.</p></li>
</ul>
