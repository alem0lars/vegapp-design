# VegApp

**Description & Notes of the VegApp development process.**

---

## Development process

When developing VegApp I've chosen *an Agile (and Model-Driven)
development methodology*.

In the first iteration I've spent most of the time in
the [analysis](./analysis/README.md).

Then, when both the requirements and the problem was clear to me, I've
started to [design](./design/README.md) the product.

Finally, I've [implement](./implement/README.md)ed the designed
artifacts.
