<h3 id="material-ui-principles">Material UI principles</h3>
<p><strong>We'll try to follow the Material UI principles as much as possible.</strong></p>
<h4 id="material-is-the-metaphor">Material is the metaphor</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a <em>system of motion</em>. The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. <em>The use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances</em>. Yet the flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical world, without breaking the rules of physics.</p></li>
<li><p>The fundamentals of <em>light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other</em>. Realistic lighting shows seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bold-graphic-intentional">Bold, graphic, intentional</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The foundational elements of <em>print-based design-typography, grids, space, scale, color, and use of imagery-guide visual treatments</em>. These elements do far more than please the eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic interface that immerse the user in the experience.</p></li>
<li><p>An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides waypoints for the user.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="motion-provides-meaning">Motion provides meaning</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.</p></li>
<li><p>All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user <em>without breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Motion is <em>meaningful</em> and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efficient yet <em>coherent</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="material-ui-colors">Material UI colors</h3>
<p>The colors used are compliant with the <a href="http://www.google.it/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette">Google Material UI color palette</a>.</p>
<p>This involves <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/material/theme.html#ColorPalette">using the material theme</a>.</p>
<p>The colors chosen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green as Primary.</li>
<li>Orange as Accent.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to the following color palettes:</p>
<p><img src="./data/design/colors-palette-primary.svg" style="width: 40%; vertical-align: top; padding: 0 12% 0 4%;" /> <img src="./data/design/colors-palette-accent.svg" style="width: 40%; vertical-align: top;" /></p>
<h3 id="material-ui-typography">Material UI typography</h3>
<p>The typography follows the <a href="http://www.google.it/design/spec/style/typography.html">Google Material UI typography guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>In particular the <code>Roboto</code> font will be used.</p>
